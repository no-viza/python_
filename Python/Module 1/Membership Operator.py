#Membership Operators.
#these check if the value is part of a sequence or not
#sequence meaning lists, tuples etc. 

string1 = "HELP ME"

print('H' in string1)
print('Z' in string1)
#as H is in string 1, the condition is TRUE

#The NOT means if the value is not present in the sequence
print('H' not in string1)
print('Z' not in string1)
#as Z is NOT in string1, the condition is TRUE

#Identity Operators 
#helps to IDENTIFY if 2 values are the same

var1 = 10
var2 = 10
var3 = 5

#IS Operator
print(var1 is var2)
print(var1 is var3)

#IS NOT Operator
print(var1 is not var2)
print(var1 is not var3)

#Operator Precedence 

var4 = 5 ** 2 + 7
var5 = 3 + 6 ** 2

print(var4)
print(var5)

#there's a whole list og operator precedence in Python
